Final year project:
Implementing a face recognition system based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in libraries represents a significant leap towards enhancing security, efficiency, and user experience. The conventional method of logging library entries manually in books is prone to data loss and becomes cumbersome when managing a multitude of records. By leveraging CNN, which excels in image recognition tasks, the proposed solution ensures accurate identification of faculty and student logins and logouts. This not only strengthens security through the unique facial features authentication but also streamlines the process, eliminating manual errors and providing a more seamless user experience. The move towards automated, technology-driven attendance tracking not only mitigates the risk of data loss associated with manual methods but also aligns with modern standards of data confidentiality and user privacy, critical elements in services delivered over open networks.
